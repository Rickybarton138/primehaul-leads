    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using PrimeHaul's services, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>

    <h2>2. Services</h2>
    <p>PrimeHaul provides AI-powered moving quotes and inventory estimation. We connect consumers with removal companies across the UK. Our estimates are generated using artificial intelligence and are indicative — final pricing is confirmed by the removal company.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate information about your move</li>
        <li>Upload photos only of your own property</li>
        <li>Use the service for legitimate moving enquiries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Our inventory estimates and price quotes are generated by AI and should be treated as approximations. PrimeHaul is not liable for differences between estimated and actual moving costs.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Handling</h2>
    <p>Your data is handled in accordance with our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. Photos uploaded for inventory estimation are processed by AI and stored securely.</p>

    <h2>6. Social Media</h2>
    <p>PrimeHaul maintains social media accounts for marketing and informational purposes. Content published on our social channels does not constitute advice or a contractual offer.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>PrimeHaul acts as an intermediary connecting consumers with removal companies. We are not a removal company and are not liable for the performance of removal services.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
